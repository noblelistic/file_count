# file_count
For now the read me the same as the, for the most part as the header in main.cpp

 main.cpp of the FileCount program
 Program takes string of file name ending in .txt and adds all numbers in file. If there is a 
 string it will be assumed to be another file name. Number and strings must be one per line.
 If file has no numbers then the file total is 0. Program treats all files has separate even
 if they are the same. Be careful not to do repeat nest(ex. If a.txt has b.txt in it then a.txt
 can not be in b.txt). This will cause an infinte loop, stack overflow. In order the open file 
 that the user inputs file must be in local directory.
